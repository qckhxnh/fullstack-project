Author's Note:
This project, StayMate, was entirely designed and developed by me as an individual effort. Although GitHub shows another contributor in the commit history, this was an unintentional result of a credential misconfiguration during Git operations.

I am the sole developer responsible for all planning, coding, UI/UX design, testing, and documentation.

The mistakenly attributed contributor (e.g., shubh2294) was never involved in the development of this project.
