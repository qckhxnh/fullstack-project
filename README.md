# StayMate

## Description

**StayMate** is a full-stack homestay booking platform developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It allows users to register, list their own properties, book available homestays, and chat with hosts or renters. It showcases the complete development and integration of both frontend and backend systems.

This project is structured into two main directories:

- **client**: React-based frontend.
- **server**: Node.js and Express-based backend.

## Installation

To set up StayMate locally:

2. Clone this repository.
3. In both `client` and `server` folders, run `npm install`.
4. Create `.env` files in both folders with the following settings:

### Server `.env`

```

PORT=3001
JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
```

### Client `.env`

```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=<your_upload_preset>
